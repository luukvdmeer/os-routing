# Open Source Routing Engines

This repository contains scripts, data and output files meant to test different open source routing engines in Austria. Routing eninges for street network routing, public transit routing and multi-modal routing are considered. The tests are still at a pretty basic level and are just meant to quickly explore the advantages and disadvantages of the engines. It is by no means considered to be a complete review of *all* open-source routing engines that are available.

Setup steps are described for Ubuntu 16.04, but will with some modifications probably not be too different for other operating systems.

Explored engines up to now:

- [GraphHopper](/graphhopper)
- [OSRM](/osrm)
